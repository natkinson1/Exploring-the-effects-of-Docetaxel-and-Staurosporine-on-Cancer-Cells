# Exploring-the-effects-of-Docetaxel-and-Staurosporine-on-Cancer-Cells
Image data has been collected over a 72 hour period to study the behaviour of cancerous cells before and after being treated by the drug Docetaxel, a drug used in chemotherapy for breast, prostate and stomach cancer[9], and Staurosporine, a natural chemical compound with known anti-cancerous properties. Data such as volume, sphericity and area has been extracted using a state-of-the-art Phasefocus microscope along with their cell tracking software, which captures images of label-free cells and with minimal light. As the image data has been collected overtime, one can observe how the physical properties of the cell change overtime. The cells treated with Staurosporine have been treated with two concentrations, 3.7mM and 33.3mM. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA), a machine learning algorithm, was used to classify untreated and treated cells for the Docetaxel drug. LDA was also used to classify cells treated with the two concentrations of Staurosporine. Further to this, pixel boundary data for the cells treated with Staurosporine have been collected. Shape descriptors such as roundness and compactness have been extracted from this data. These new features gave new information about the cells which were added to produce a more accurate model for classifying cells treated with Staurosporine.
